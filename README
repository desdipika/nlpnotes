A repository of all my NLP and ML related note-making I do while studying or researching online or reading research papers or during classes or during coding sessions. 

The aim is to have an immediate reference manual of any query or doubt I may have in regard to specific terms and jargon and I hope to make notes that are comprehensive enough to meet the aim. The idea with this note-making journal is to keep it breadth-specific too understand my areas of interest and comfort while familiarizing with all the different prospective subareas for research and application development. 

If there's anyone using my notes, I'd be more than happy if you stopped by to say hello. 

Cheers!
